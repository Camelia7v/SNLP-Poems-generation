# State of the art

* https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09534 - Creative GANs for generating poems, lyrics, and metaphors - a GAN approach for generating poems in English

* https://aclanthology.org/P17-1016.pdf - Automatically Generating Rhythmic Verse with Neural Networks - a softer method based on a LSTM (English) and applied poetic directions

* https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04114.pdf - GENERATE AND REVISE: REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN NEURAL POETRY - a method based on a bi-LSTM, including several experiments and postprocessing techniques (English)

* https://aclanthology.org/D14-1074.pdf - Chinese Poetry Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks - poem generator experiments on convolutional and recurrent networks, tested using BLEU score and human volunteers.

## Conclusion
 The common point of all these papers consists in Neural Network type approaches, more precisely a Deep Learning one.
 
 We will try use a GAN arhitecture in which the Generator is a Transformer and the Discriminator is a simple network.

 We consider each word a token meant to be generated by the Generator along with other tokens in order to create a strophe/stanza.
 
 Our goal is to generate a plausible poem in Romanian
