## Conclusion
 The common point of all these papers consists in Neural Network type approaches, more precisely a Deep Learning one.
 
 We will try use a GAN arhitecture in which the Generator is a Transformer and the Discriminator is a simple network.
 
 We consider each word a token meant to be generated by the Generator along with other tokens in order to create a strophe/stanza.
 
 Our goal is to generate a plausible poem in Romanian, starting from some keywords and other parameters given by the user.
